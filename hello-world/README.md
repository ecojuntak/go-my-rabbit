On this tutorial, I learned
- How to create connection from both the sender and receiver to the RabbitMQ server.
- How create new channel, naming channel, and connecting sender and receiver in one channel. I also learn what if I give the different channel name, of course the sender and receiver can't connect.
- How to publish message from sender and consume the message on receiver
